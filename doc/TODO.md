# TODO
This is a quick to-do list of items not big enough to be placed in the issue 
tracker. It is mainly intended for the technical debt.s

1. Delete Perl installation on Windows and try to find it with REQUIRED. After 
it is built and installed, it is still not found and the configure fails. 
If configure is run again, it is found without needing another build/install.
